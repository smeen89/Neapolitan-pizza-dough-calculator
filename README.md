<h1>Neapolitan pizza dough calculator </h1>

<h2>This calculator aims to:</h2>

<b>1. Simplify scaling of a dough recipe by automaticly calculate dough weight based on:</b> <br>
  <b>a)</b> input of number of pizzas and<br>
  <b>b)</b> weight of each pizza
  
 <b>2. Calculate required amount of fresh yeast based on:</b><br>
   <b>a)</b> surrounding temperature of the dough throughout the fermentation i.e room temperature (or fridge temperature)<br>
   <b>b)</b> time until baking out the pizzas.
   
   <i>Note: I've used Kronjäst Blå (from Sweden). Different yeast types and brands may give different results.</i>
   
 <b>3. Make it easy for the user to change hydration and salt levels to encourage experimentation.</b>
 
 <h2>Some quick notes on how to make pizza dough:</h2><br>
 <b>1.</b> Start by mixing the ingreedients until they form a rough dough. No need for stretcinh or kneeding.<br>
 <b>2.</b> Cover dough and wait for 30 minutes<br>
 <b>3.</b> Fold the dough over itself five times.<br>
 <b>4.</b> Cover dough and wait for 15 minutes.<br>
 <b>5.</b> Fold the dough over itself five times.<br>
 <b>6.</b> Cover dough and wait for 15 minutes.<br>
 <b>7.</b> Fold the dough over itself five times.<br>
 <b>8.</b> Now it's time for bulk fermentation.<br><br>
 <i>I usually let the dough bulk ferment for half of the fermentation time, and then ferment for the rest of the time as individual dough balls.<br> 
 Please feel fre to try out what you prefer.</i><br><br>
 
 <h2>This repository consists of 4 main files in order for anyone to duplicate my Neapolitan pizza calculator for Home Assistant</h2><br>
   
<b>The 4 main files consists of:</b><br>
<b>1.</b> HACS repositories - i.e a list of links to github repositories for Home Assistant that I've used for the setup.<br>
<b>2.</b> Input Helpers - a list of the input helpers (names and settings) that needs to be created in order for the calculator to work.<br>
<b>3.</b> Yaml code - the code needs to go in your configuration.yaml file. This sets up the calculation and the sensors needed.<br>
<b>4.</b> Lovelace UI card yaml code - this is the code for the user interface and goes in your lovelace view.<br>
